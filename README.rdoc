Similar to the , the Artist Game 

Similar to the [Wiki Game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game), players (one or more) start by selecting two artists or specific artworks. The goal is to traverse through the first artist/artwork page to arrive at the second artist/artwork in the least amount of time. 

It is an explorative and learning game aiming to playfully recognize relationships between art entities. Enjoy!
